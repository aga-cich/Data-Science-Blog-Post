# How to make a Highly Recommended chocolate bar with Python
### This is a project within the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

## Libraries used
- pandas `import pandas as pd`
- numpy  `import numpy as np`
- matplotlib.pyplot `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`
- seaborn `import seaborn as sns`
- collections `import collections`
- itertools.combinations `from itertools import combinations`

## Motivation for the project
The goal of this project is to analyze the data from the database of Chocolate Bar Ratings to determine the most popular characteristics among good chocolate bars. If we were to make our own chocolate bar:
1. What cocoa percentage should we use?
2. Where should we buy the beans?
3. What taste characteristics are valuable? What should we aim for?
4. What ingredients should we use? Is there a difference between the ingredients of the very best bars compared to to the very worst bars?

## Summary of the results
1. The most successful bars tend to have 70% of cocoa or slighly more.
2. Top 5 locations to look for beans are: Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Dominic Republic and Madagascar.
3. The most popular taste characteristics among the best bars are: the cocoa taste, creaminess and nuttiness.
4. The safest option for the ingredients is the combination of Beans, Sugar and Cocoa Butter. This choice is much more popular among the best bars in comparison to the worst bars.
